        Hello! <br>
        I'm Koh.ðŸ‘‹ <br>
        A Student. A Programmer. <br>
      </p> 
      <p>
        Welcome to my corner of the internet! 
        I'm an aspiring web developer from Ohio, currently based in Portugal. Having a curious mind and being obsessed with learning how and why things work, I'm currently seeking to learn more about creating stylish, modern, responsive websites. I love how technology is always advancing and making our lives easier. Now, I'm on my journey to break into tech and am looking for opportunities to learn and grow! 
        <br>
        Follow along and see where it takes me!

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello again! â˜º Let me reintroduce myself.<br>
        My name is Koh Takamasa. I'm currently a first year student at BYU-I majoring in Applied Technology. 
        While working in the restaurant industry, I always felt like something was missing. And in high school, I felt lost in what major and career to pursue. One thing was that I have always liked computers and have been mesmerized by responsive websites with amazing visual designs. So, after much time going back and forth between computer science, mechanical engineering, accounting, education, and psychology (I know, I wanted to do everything. Sorry for having a curious mindðŸ˜…) Ultimately, I chose to learn how to code starting with  resources like freeCodeCamp and Codecademy, and now I'm loving learning about it!
      </p>

        During my free time <br>
        - jamming out and playing guitar<br>
        - hanging out with my beautiful wife
        - going out and exploring
      </p>

      <h3>Works</h3>
      <p>
        I'm still learning, but I'm having fun! Here's what I'm currently working on and some projects that I've worked on. Check them out, and I hope you like them! <br><br>
        <strong>Currently: Dry Oar - Whitewater Rafting</strong><br>
        A website for a fictional whitewater rafting company created for my Web Development and Design - Web Fundamentals class. It's the first website that I created!  <br><br> 
        <strong>Snake Game and Basic Calculator</strong><br>
        As I started to learn some basic JavaScript, I was recommended to work on some projects. It was definitely a big learning curve, and I still need to practice and learn a lot. Inspired by @effective_dev and his 30 days of JavaScript and projects, I was able to finish my first couple projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
